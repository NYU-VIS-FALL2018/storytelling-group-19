Authors: Madhura Sridhar and YiChun Yeh

Professor: Enrico Bertini

Description: We hope to explore some of the common questions that arise when going through the Goodbooks review dataset, concerning the popularity of books based on the user ratings they garnered, visualize more information about the authors using the existing dataset and visualize the review of the most popular author in the form of a word cloud, all using D3, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, using the Bootstrap front-end framework.
